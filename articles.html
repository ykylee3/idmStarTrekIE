                        see it all. We here at Star Trek Éire love it! We highly recommend binge watching the whole 4 seasons.  We were
                        hoping Netflix might bring out a 5th season of it but this looks less and less likely..</p>

                        <h6>Star Trek Enterprise</h6>
                        <p>I was 13 when Enterprise started. Having been brought into the world of star trek by my dad, we both made a weekly thing to watch this new series.
                          I can’t really remember when I stopped watching, but I would wager it was about half way through the second season. At the time I remember it not having the same feel as anything I had seen before so I got bored and dropped off. My dad battled on for a little longer, but having the same feeling he gave up as well.
                          Years later I heard from various friends that I should have stuck with it as it picked up, so I always said I would revisit it.</p>

                                      <p>I think The Next Generation is the best series to introduce your kids to the Star Trek Universe. It’s bright and colourful, has plenty of relatively
                                        straightforward concepts such as diversity, equality and fairness, and Starfleet’s finest provide several great role models in multiple careers
                                        (there should be a better balance among the sexes but let’s hope Star Trek 2017 attends to that).</p>
                                        <p>If you’re thinking of showing your kids Star Trek, hopefully this guide will be of use to you. (Update: I did intend this to be a regular
                                          instalment, so maybe I’ll get back to it! I will go through each episode that I have watched with my daughter with a brief description, and
                                          potential lessons to be learned, including ratings and comments from our young reviewer Róisín!  Be prepared to pause some episodes now and
                                          again to help explain to your child what is going on, especially when it’s techno-babble heavy!  First up is season 4 episode ‘Data’s Day’.</p>

                                    park in the heart of Dublin, I was so honoured. Much is known about his time on Deep Space Nine, but what is not
                                    generally known is his love affair with Earth, and in particular acting. </p>

                                            <p>I managed to catch up with one of my favourite stars recently, Odo.  When he suggested we meet in St. Stephen’s Green park in the heart of Dublin, I was so honoured.
                                              Much is known about his time on Deep Space Nine, but what is not generally known is his love affair with Earth, and in particular acting.  Media reviews have
                                              included some lovely remarks – Changing Times June 2008: ‘Odo’s shape shifting abilities are unprecedented’.  Vanity Fair just this year: ‘Odo’s few years in the
                                              Great Link have given him such a range of characters that he can dip into at a moment’s notice’. To help us visualise this love affair, he kindly provided me with
                                              a number of pictures that he holds close to his heart.</p>

                                              <p>After Odo’s brief visit to Earth in 1947, he always intended on coming back a few years later as he ‘wanted to immerse himself’.  It was a mixed experience
                                                at first. Due to the whole ‘alien’ issue that still exists in some circles, he found himself limited in career options.  He decided to try his hand at acting.
                                                As Odo admits ‘after I initially tried to tell a few humans about who I really was, I mainly got a very scared reaction, well apart from Willie’. Odo is
                                                referring to William Wyler who gave him his first role, albeit risky, as the spike on the Roman chariot in ‘Ben Hur’.</p>

                                                    <p>The consensus seems to be that this new series will be set in the prime universe. There are several reasons to believe
                                                      this. As we’ve mentioned in previous articles it’s very unlikely to be set in the JJ Abrams reboot universe for legal
                                                      reasons. Paramount own the movie rights to Star Trek and CBS retain the Television rights. This means that even if they
                                                      wanted to make a series set in the new timeline they would have to make a deal with Paramount. A deal that wouldn’t be in CBS’s
                                                      financial interest. This is a good thing as it means CBS are in a position to realistically do two things. Set ST17 in the
                                                      original canon universe or create their own new, new timeline. Creating another new timeline makes absolutely no sense as they
                                                      should know that they have already alienated millions of fans with the reboots. For the money it makes sense to stick to the
                                                      canon universe.</p>

                                                        <p>What makes Star Trek so wonderful is the dedication from so many people coming at different angles to weave the tapestry
                                                          together. It’s easy to celebrate all the wonderful actors that have played such iconic parts in Star Trek, but
                                                          unfortunately those behind the scenes don’t get as much plaudits. I remember attending the Destination Star Trek
                                                          convention in London in 2012 and the attention the actors got compared to the writers was obvious. I must admit,
                                                          I was Rick_Sternbachone of those who didn’t allocate enough time to Ronald D. Moore, Brannon Braga and Ira Steven Behr.
                                                          In my defense it’s hard to cram everything in! I have felt guilty about that and look forward to paying them the respect
                                                          they deserve in the future.</p>

                                                                          society. It was this ground breaking social commentary that made Star Trek the dynasty it is today. It’s a tone of
